                    Hi! My name is Spencer Means and I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin.
                    I am majoring in computer science and plan to graduate with a bachelor's degree and a
                    certificate in Business Foundations. I love creating new and unique things, solving
                    puzzles, and meeting new people.
                </p>
